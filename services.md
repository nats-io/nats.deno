# Services Framework

The Services Framework introduces a higher-level API for implementing services
with NATS. NATS has always been a strong technology on which to build services,
as they are easy to write, are location and DNS independent and can be scaled up
or down by simply adding or removing instances of the service.

The Services Framework further streamlines their development by providing
observability and standardization. The Service Framework allows your services to
be discovered, queried for status and schema information without additional
work.
