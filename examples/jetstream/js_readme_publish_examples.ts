// have the same ID:
await js.publish("a.b", Empty, { msgID: "a" });

// For example, you can request the message to have as its
// last sequence before accepting the new message:
await js.publish("a.b", Empty, { expect: { lastMsgID: "a" } });
await js.publish("a.b", Empty, { expect: { lastSequence: 3 } });
// save the last sequence for this publish
pa = await js.publish("a.b", Empty, { expect: { streamName: "a" } });

// now if you have a stream with different subjects, you can also
// assert that the last recorded sequence on subject on the stream matches
